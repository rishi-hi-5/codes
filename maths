some logical math related things

1. To identify multiple of three :
	take the difference of even and odd bit by shifting the odd bit one by one and checking whether it is one , if it is the increment the count for the respective position and if the difference between even and odde bits is divisble by three then the number is multiple of three

2. To multiply the number by 7 :
	multiply the number by 8 by shifting to right and then substract the orignal number form the number obtained i.e 8n-n which gives us the number multiplied by 7

	the same ways can be used to obtain the multiply by other numbers also like if i want to multiply the current number by 9 the this that i will have to do is shift the number by three and the add the original number to it and you get 8n+n which is the required result

	silmilary goes for other numbers

3.finding the square root by babylonian method
	decide the accuracy value in a variable then itereate through the loop till the valu
	x=x+y/2 is called the babylonian equation where y is x/y which is a guess ,first we initialize the guess to be one . then we check the the whether x-y is below our accurate measure if yes we stop else we perform the operation again .x-y>e tells that what distance apart are actually this 2 numbers if they are less than the required value we get our answer

4. Magic square . the sum for the magic square is formula n*(n^2-1)/2. the magic numbers can be found 	 as follows
	1 - n/2,n-1
	for future numbers do the wrapping as needed
	just decrement row by 1 and increment column by 1
	if there is number that exist from the beginning then increment row by 1 and decrement column by 2(row and column are the calculated ones)
	if row is -1 and column points then the number lies at 0 and n-2 location that is the remaining slot

5. Identify the multiple of 7 
	use this formula a+2b where 
	a is the the number not containing the last digit and b is the last digit 
	recurse until we get the number as 0 or 7 else if number < 10 than declare the number is not divisble by 7

6. Find the largest multiple of 2 3 and 5
	for doing this we first find if the given number contains a zero because then only it would be divisble by 5 and also by the question is for 3 where we have to find the largest multiple using the given set which can be done by keeping the following properties in mind

	i.the sum of the digit is same for all the combination of the elements provided
	ii. remainder for number is similar to the remainder of sum of the digit % 3
	on the basis of this the following algorithm works

	first find the respective remainder and sum and maintain three queues for three different remainder
	then check whether 
	sum%3==1 : if yes remove one element from q1 else remove 2 elements from q2 else the number doesnt exist

	sum%3==2 : if yes remove one element from the q2 else reove to element from q1 if q2 is empty else the no such number exist for the given set

	sum%3==0 : populate aux array by dequeuing elements from q and sort it and present the number

	print the array

7. formula for calculating e^x
	can be imagined by considering the series
		e^x=1+x/1+x^2./2!+...
		simplified version
		e^x=1+x/1(1+x/2(1+x/3..))

		this can be imagined by considering a for loop 
		sum=1+x*sum/i where i raised to value

8. efficient program to print all the prime factors 
	first divide the number by 2 and print 2 until it is odd after that 
	run a loop from 3 to sqroot(n) and see if the number is divisble by it if yes divide it and outputh the factor
	if no and the number is greater that 2 then print the number that indicates its a prime factor of the given number

9. to check whether a given number is fibonacci or not
	A number is Fibonacci if and only if one or both of (5*n2 + 4) or (5*n2 â€“ 4) is a perfect square

10. efficient algorithm for multiplication (Russian peasant multiplication):
		suppose we want the result for the number a*b for that the following steps

		double one number halve another number if havled number becomes odd add the doubled number to the result else continue until halved number becomes 1

11. horners method to evaluate the polynomial for the given x
		suppose the given polynmial is as follows
			2 x^3 - 6 x^2 + 2^x - 1
			then we can simplify the above polynomial as

			((2x-6)x+2)x-1 

			so by doing this we can now easily perform our required opertion in O(n) time

			so the formula becomes

			first initialize the result to highest degree coefficient then multiply it with x and add the number obtained with next coefficient which is further added to our result

12. counting trailing zero in factorial 
		we now trailing zero is a result of multiplication of 5 and 2 so if we can keep track of 5 and two we can get the required result. By taking some example we can observe that the no of twos is always greater than 5 that means to get the number of trailing zero we only have to keep a track of 5 in that number. this technique remove single five if we want to remove more 5 which appear more that ones in number for example 25=5*5 so will have to divide the number by 25
		similarly goes for numbers after 125 = 5*5*5 This helps in removing excess five that are required in result

		railing 0s in n! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!= floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....

13. catlan number 
		some interesting fact catlan number lie in pascals triangle
		i have liked the video for the explanation of catlan number https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Khxn2g-6w . htis is the best explanation if you want to understand the catlan number and code

14. To find out the angle between hour and minute hand we use the given formula
		angle=(h*60+m)*0.5-m*6
		where  theata h    theata m

15. to find the strings of binary without consecutive for given number of bits it can be easily 		obtained by finding out the fibonacci series

16. Find the smallest number whose digits multiply to a given number n find this one on geeks for 		geeks 

17. Returns approximate number of people for a given probability
		int find(double p)
		{
		    return ceil(sqrt(2*365*log(1/(1-p))));
		}
